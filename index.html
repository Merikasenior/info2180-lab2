    <h2> Why Web Design?</h2> 
    <p class="date">October 1, 2022 by Merika Senior</p>
 <p>Web Design is the process of creating, making, and developing websites. It includes many different features such as webpage layout, webpage content, and also graphic designs. In general web design and web development work together, but the term web design is an actual category of web development. The main way of creating websites is building it from scratch using HTML language; which stands for Hypertext markup language. Web designers build websites using HTML tags that define the content of each page. The layout of the webpage and the appearance of all the elements will be built by using CSS; which stands for Cascading Style sheets.</p>

 <p>It’s never too late to start this course and I know if I put time and effort into this.I know I will love it and I can be good at it. As a student doing Information Technolgy I will create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and function according to the coursework.Web designing has really developed over time ever since the “World Wide Web” was created and it has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility. The requirements for this occupation vary with what kind of work that they do, they can range from a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree. </p>

    <h2> Why is it important? </h2> 
    <p class="date"> October 2,2022 by Merika Senior</p>
 <p>Many web designers prefer to build a web page starting from scratch by typing HTML and CSS codes, and others they prefer using a software for building and designing these webpages. Some of these soft wares to build and design websites are Dream Weaver which is mostly being used on MAC operating system or WordPress and Joomla which makes it easier for the web designer to design the webpage using the templates that these software already have listed, when the designer choose which template to use the software will automatically build the HTML and CSS files to create that template which also saves time and energy of writing those codes.</p>

<p> Therefore, all of the websites are being of combination of HTML and CSS files to define of how the page going to appear to the client or user.  My choice in doing infromation Technology and doing the course Web Devlopment, and I chose this because even though I don’t know everything about computers I am very fast at learning about them.</p>
